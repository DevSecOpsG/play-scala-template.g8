## Linting

Scala is a non-opinionated language, that allows for different styles of programming and coding structure. The syntax is rich, and so are its semantics. The learning curve is very steep, and throwing new Scala developers into projects often result in them mixing styles between what they know from previous professional experiences and what they have read online.

Leveraging the compiler to help developers identify which of their habits Scala provides a better alternative for would be very useful. It is better to increase the number of errors and inattention mistakes the compiler catches, and let the developer disable those rules locally when they absolutely need to go dirty. Enabling some constraining compiler-flags with the ```-Xfatal-warnings``` option can help the developer adopt good practice, at the risk of them initially feeling infantilized at.

As engineers that customers look up to, we should show a high level of discipline.
