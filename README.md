# Project Templates
Place for Gitter8 templates to accelerate project startup and to provide the current "status quo" of project layout and configuration.

## Preface

Cake Solutions' projects often require making similar non-functional decisions, that the engineers identify through their experiences on several projects. Identifying those decisions and factoring them in a company-wide method, whether through documentation or libraries of code, helps developers focusing on the functional problems raised by the clients.

Those methods should be untied as much as possible from specific technologies or frameworks that compose the client's final product. A traditional sprint 0 in a Cake project involves the same initial setup over and over again.  We have the same discussion over compiler flags and which SBT plugins to use. The purpose of this set of templates is to accelerate the start up of the project allowing engineers to investigate and spike the interesting problem in the project.  Whilst using the latest agreed project setup.

## Your opinion matters

As an engineer, your opinion matters. Do not follow this template blindly, however try and understand the reasons for the choices behind it. Do not be afraid to propose an alternative when you think there is a better way to the problems tackled here.
